# Surgical Gym: A high-performance GPU-based platform for surgical robot learning 

As the field of medical surgery evolves, one of its significant breakthroughs is the incorporation of robotic assistance. These surgical robots, operated meticulously by surgeons from a dedicated control station, have enabled unparalleled precision during intricate procedures. Not only do these robots mimic the surgeon's nuanced movements in real-time, but they also neutralize any inadvertent tremors, ensuring surgical accuracy. Although robots assist in over a million surgical operations annually, their operation remains human-dependent, lacking autonomy. The pursuit of automation in surgical robots promises not just increased efficiency but also reduced surgeon fatigue. Recent applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in devising control strategies indicate a bright future for automated surgeries. Yet, the vast data demands of RL, combined with the absence of inherent domain knowledge, present a challenge. Recently the robotics domain has been revolutionized through the use of GPU-based physics simulators, accessing magnitudes more data than their CPU counterparts. This library introduces the Surgical Gym, an open-source platform optimized for GPU capabilities which runs XYZx faster than previous surgical simulators.

## About this repository

This repository contains Surgical Robotic Learning tasks that can be run with the latest release of [Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/overview.html). Reinforcement Learning (RL) examples are trained using PPO from [rl_games](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games) library and examples are built on top of Isaac Sim's `omni.isaac.core` and `omni.isaac.gym` frameworks. The environment design structure inherits from [OmniIsaacGymEnvs](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OmniIsaacGymEnvs).

## Installation

Follow the Isaac Sim [documentation](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/install_basic.html) to install the latest Isaac Sim release. 

*Examples in this repository rely on features from the most recent Isaac Sim release. Please make sure to update any existing Isaac Sim build to the latest release version, 2022.2.1, to ensure examples work as expected.*

Once installed, this repository can be used as a python module, `omniisaacgymenvs`, with the python executable provided in Isaac Sim.

To install `omniisaacgymenvs`, first clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OmniIsaacGymEnvs.git
```

Once cloned, locate the [python executable in Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/install_python.html). By default, this should be `python.sh`. We will refer to this path as `PYTHON_PATH`.

To set a `PYTHON_PATH` variable in the terminal that links to the python executable, we can run a command that resembles the following. Make sure to update the paths to your local path.

```
For Linux: alias PYTHON_PATH=~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-*/python.sh
For Windows: doskey PYTHON_PATH=C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\ov\pkg\isaac_sim-*\python.bat $*
For IsaacSim Docker: alias PYTHON_PATH=/isaac-sim/python.sh
```

Install `omniisaacgymenvs` as a python module for `PYTHON_PATH`:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH -m pip install -e .
```

The following error may appear during the initial installation. This error is harmless and can be ignored.

```
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
```


### Running the examples

*Note: all commands should be executed from `SurgicalGym/surgicalgym`.*

To train your first policy, run:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=ECM
```

You should see an Isaac Sim window pop up. Once Isaac Sim initialization completes, the ECM target reaching scene will be constructed and simulation will start running automatically. The process will terminate once training finishes.

Note that by default, we show a Viewport window with rendering, which slows down training. You can choose to close the Viewport window during training for better performance. The Viewport window can be re-enabled by selecting `Window > Viewport` from the top menu bar.

To achieve maximum performance, you can launch training in `headless` mode as follows:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=ECM headless=True
```

#### A Note on the Startup Time of the Simulation

Some of the examples could take a few minutes to load because the startup time scales based on the number of environments. The startup time will continually
be optimized in future releases.


### Loading trained models // Checkpoints

Checkpoints are saved in the folder `runs/EXPERIMENT_NAME/nn` where `EXPERIMENT_NAME` 
defaults to the task name, but can also be overridden via the `experiment` argument.

To load a trained checkpoint and continue training, use the `checkpoint` argument:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=runs/Ant/nn/Ant.pth
```

To load a trained checkpoint and only perform inference (no training), pass `test=True` 
as an argument, along with the checkpoint name. To avoid rendering overhead, you may 
also want to run with fewer environments using `num_envs=64`:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=runs/Ant/nn/Ant.pth test=True num_envs=64
```

Note that if there are special characters such as `[` or `=` in the checkpoint names, 
you will need to escape them and put quotes around the string. For example,
`checkpoint="runs/Ant/nn/last_Antep\=501rew\[5981.31\].pth"`

We provide pre-trained checkpoints on the [Nucleus](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_nucleus/prod_nucleus/overview.html) server under `Assets/Isaac/2022.2.1/Isaac/Samples/OmniIsaacGymEnvs/Checkpoints`. Run the following command
to launch inference with pre-trained checkpoint:

Localhost (To set up localhost, please refer to the [Isaac Sim installation guide](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/install_basic.html)):

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=omniverse://localhost/NVIDIA/Assets/Isaac/2022.2.1/Isaac/Samples/OmniIsaacGymEnvs/Checkpoints/ant.pth test=True num_envs=64
```

Production server:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=http://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/2022.2.1/Isaac/Samples/OmniIsaacGymEnvs/Checkpoints/ant.pth test=True num_envs=64
```

When running with a pre-trained checkpoint for the first time, we will automatically download the checkpoint file to `omniisaacgymenvs/checkpoints`. For subsequent runs, we will re-use the file that has already been downloaded, and will not overwrite existing checkpoints with the same name in the `checkpoints` folder.
### Configuration and command line arguments

We use [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) to manage the config.
 
Common arguments for the training scripts are:

* `task=TASK` - Selects which task to use. Any of `AllegroHand`, `Ant`, `Anymal`, `AnymalTerrain`, `BallBalance`, `Cartpole`, `Crazyflie`, `FactoryTaskNutBoltPick`, `FrankaCabinet`, `Humanoid`, `Ingenuity`, `Quadcopter`, `ShadowHand`, `ShadowHandOpenAI_FF`, `ShadowHandOpenAI_LSTM` (these correspond to the config for each environment in the folder `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/task`)
* `train=TRAIN` - Selects which training config to use. Will automatically default to the correct config for the environment (ie. `<TASK>PPO`).
* `num_envs=NUM_ENVS` - Selects the number of environments to use (overriding the default number of environments set in the task config).
* `seed=SEED` - Sets a seed value for randomization, and overrides the default seed in the task config
* `pipeline=PIPELINE` - Which API pipeline to use. Defaults to `gpu`, can also set to `cpu`. When using the `gpu` pipeline, all data stays on the GPU. When using the `cpu` pipeline, simulation can run on either CPU or GPU, depending on the `sim_device` setting, but a copy of the data is always made on the CPU at every step.
* `sim_device=SIM_DEVICE` - Device used for physics simulation. Set to `gpu` (default) to use GPU and to `cpu` for CPU.
* `device_id=DEVICE_ID` - Device ID for GPU to use for simulation and task. Defaults to `0`. This parameter will only be used if simulation runs on GPU.
* `rl_device=RL_DEVICE` - Which device / ID to use for the RL algorithm. Defaults to `cuda:0`, and follows PyTorch-like device syntax.
* `multi_gpu=MULTI_GPU` - Whether to train using multiple GPUs. Defaults to `False`. Note that this option is only available with `rlgames_train.py`.
* `test=TEST`- If set to `True`, only runs inference on the policy and does not do any training.
* `checkpoint=CHECKPOINT_PATH` - Path to the checkpoint to load for training or testing.
* `headless=HEADLESS` - Whether to run in headless mode.
* `enable_livestream=ENABLE_LIVESTREAM` - Whether to enable Omniverse streaming.
* `experiment=EXPERIMENT` - Sets the name of the experiment.
* `max_iterations=MAX_ITERATIONS` - Sets how many iterations to run for. Reasonable defaults are provided for the provided environments.

Hydra also allows setting variables inside config files directly as command line arguments. As an example, to set the minibatch size for a rl_games training run, you can use `train.params.config.minibatch_size=64`. Similarly, variables in task configs can also be set. For example, `task.env.episodeLength=100`.

#### Hydra Notes

Default values for each of these are found in the `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/config.yaml` file.

The way that the `task` and `train` portions of the config works are through the use of config groups. 
You can learn more about how these work [here](https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/structured_config/config_groups/)
The actual configs for `task` are in `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/task/<TASK>.yaml` and for `train` in `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/train/<TASK>PPO.yaml`. 

In some places in the config you will find other variables referenced (for example,
 `num_actors: ${....task.env.numEnvs}`). Each `.` represents going one level up in the config hierarchy.
 This is documented fully [here](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#variable-interpolation).

### Tensorboard

Tensorboard can be launched during training via the following command:
```bash
PYTHON_PATH -m tensorboard.main --logdir runs/EXPERIMENT_NAME/summaries
```

## WandB support

You can run (WandB)[https://wandb.ai/] with OmniIsaacGymEnvs by setting `wandb_activate=True` flag from the command line. You can set the group, name, entity, and project for the run by setting the `wandb_group`, `wandb_name`, `wandb_entity` and `wandb_project` arguments. Make sure you have WandB installed in the Isaac Sim Python executable with `PYTHON_PATH -m pip install wandb` before activating.


## Training with Multiple GPUs

To train with multiple GPUs, use the following command, where `--proc_per_node` represents the number of available GPUs:
```bash
PYTHON_PATH -m torch.distributed.run --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=2 scripts/rlgames_train.py headless=True task=Ant multi_gpu=True
```

## Tasks

Source code for tasks can be found in `SurgicalGym/surgicalgym`. 

Each task follows the frameworks provided in `omni.isaac.core` and `omni.isaac.gym` in Isaac Sim.

Refer to [docs/framework.md](docs/framework.md) for how to create your own tasks.

Full details on each of the tasks available can be found in the [RL examples documentation](docs/rl_examples.md).
